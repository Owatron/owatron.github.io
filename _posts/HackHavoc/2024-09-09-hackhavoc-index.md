## Overview

Hack Havoc was a CTF conducted by CyberMaterial. It was a beginner-friendly CTF with challenges in Web, Crypto, OSINT, and Rev. The challenges were quite easy (maybe a little too easy) and fun to solve. Here are the write-ups for the challenges. It was spread out over like a month and 4 challenges each week were released. So, the pacing was good for any newbies to get a hang of CTFs and learn along the way.

I solved all the challenges and came 7th as the ranking was based on time of solving.
