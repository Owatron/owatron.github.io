WORK IN PROGRESS...

## wont-somebody-think-of-the-children

`medium`-`554 points`-`109 solves`

Description: *If Loab is back, we might need the council to help us out. The problem is that Anna sent Maya looking for them but she still hasn't come back. This is her last known location... Maybe you can help find her.*

*I'd go, but I really don't want to be around those spooky ghost orphans.*

## haunted-server

`medium`-`732 points`-`34 solves`

*One of our agents, Simon Letti, has been seeing some strange traffic coming from his server. He provided us with the attached disk image. NICC needs your help to find what is going on. We suspect that our enemy, RB, is somehow involved.*

## memory-puzzle

`medium`-`729 points`-`37 solves`

*The Consortium has concealed a critical file within a memory dump, protected by layers of digital obfuscation. Led by Simon Letti, participants must sift through the volatile memory landscape to locate a plaintext key that unlocks the encrypted file. Time is of the essence, as Roko's Basilisk threatens to distort the data with each passing moment. Can you unravel the puzzle before the Basilisk intervenes?*

*"Basilisk's whisper will not wait" echos through your mind as you enter the file.*

*(Note: If you choose to use volatility2.6, use profile Win10x64_19041)*
